## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Introduction

This is a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course with a strong focus on passing coding interviews for software engineering jobs.

Most DSA courses - including those offered in universities, tend to concentrate on theoretical concepts that don't matter in an interview. Most of the time, these courses present zero or few examples of problems you would see in an interview.

This course takes a very pragmatic approach to teaching DSA. The course is primarily taught through examples - it includes hundreds of carefully curated problems that show up in actual interviews. These examples are delivered through a balanced mix of walkthroughs and exercises. You will learn by doing.

Everything you need to pass coding interviews is here in one place. We will not dwell on theoretical details or waste time on concepts that won't help you pass an interview. The goal of this course is to get you a job, not pass an exam.

Regardless of your initial skill level, you should be comfortable with preparing for and passing coding interviews at tech companies after taking this course. If your target is top-tier companies like FAANG, taking this course will set you up with all the fundamentals necessary to prepare for those interviews.

### What does this course contain?

The course is split up into 13 chapters. The bulk of the content is within chapters 2 - 11, each of which focuses on a data structure or algorithm:

* Arrays and strings
* Hashmaps and sets
* Linked lists
* Stacks and queues
* Trees and graphs
* Heaps
* Greedy algorithms
* Binary search
* Backtracking
* Dynamic programming

These are the most important and most common data structures and algorithms for coding interviews.

In each of these chapters, you can expect to find:

1.  Explanation of the data structure/algorithm, what it's good at doing, how it can be used to solve problems, and details behind implementation & time/space complexity. If it's a data structure, we will also talk about the interface and how to use it.
2. Common patterns and tricks related to the data structure or algorithm.
3. Several example walkthroughs of relevant problems to help illustrate the concepts supplemented with visual aids, concise explanations, and time/space complexity analysis.
4. Precisely curated practice problems to help you build muscle memory with what you've learned.
5. We also provide a list of bonus problems at the end of each chapter. These problems are optional but can be used to reinforce the ideas learned in each chapter.

The 12th chapter contains several useful tools that can be used moving forward. There are code templates for all common patterns, cheatsheets regarding time and space complexities, and a flowchart that can be used as a general guideline when trying to figure out what data structure or algorithm should be used. We will also break down the stages of a coding interview and what you should do at each stage. To demonstrate this advice, there are example FAANG mock interview videos.

The final chapter is a bonus chapter where we will look into a few more techniques that aren't common/broad enough to warrant their own chapter.

All content is original and exclusive to this course.

### Who is this course for?

This course is designed to help everyone increase their skill and confidence in coding interviews. The explanations start small, so even if you have no experience with data structures and algorithms, you will be completely fine.

This course is perfect for you if you are someone who:

* Wants to learn data structures and algorithms for the purpose of passing coding interviews
* Is a beginner to algorithm problems and wants to build a good foundation
* Is planning to start applying soon and wants to brush up
* Is not a beginner but still wants to improve their skills in coding interviews

* The only assumption is that you already know basic coding in a common language like Java, C++, Python, or JavaScript.
